### Verification results

Due to limited experimental conditions, the same hyperparameters were used and we did not conduct particularly fine tuning. Therefore, the experimental results may be further improved.

| Model  | Accu.  | Sens.  | Spec.  | F1 Score | para. |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----- |

| Fold-9 | 93.333 | 93.750 | 92.857 | 93.750   | 12.79 |

## Usage
To run our code, you only need one GeForce RTX 4090(24G memory).

#### Preprocessing
You need to download the LUNA16 dataset by yourself and adjust the corresponding paths.
```
prepare.py \\
```
```
nodclsgbt.py \\
```
#### Search on the LUNA16 dataset

The number of pre-training epochs W in the program is the number of epochs used to solely train W. The epoch when the validation set first reaches its optimal value needs to be determined again if you plan to use your own dataset, as detailed in section 4.1 of the paper.

```
train_search.py \\
```
#### Evaluation on the LUNA16 dataset

Some randomness is introduced in certain aspects of the code, such as partial channel connections, to allow for fluctuations in results. Due to the 37-hour training time required for the model, we did not finely tune the hyperparameters, and thus the experimental results we present may not represent the optimal values.

```
python train_3D_continuation.py \\
```

### Requirements

To ensure the code can run, we provide versions of some libraries.

- python-3.7.13
- numpy-1.21.5
- pytorch-1.21.1
- pandas-1.3.5
- opencv-python-4.8.1
